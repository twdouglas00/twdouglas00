- 👋 Hi, I’m @twdouglas00
- 🤠 Pronouns: he/him
- 📫 How to reach me: email is twdouglas2000@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have had alot of knee injuries? Not really ever sure how to populate this question. I like to work out and hang with friends, but I really do like learning new things that I find interesting.

	
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to incorporate coding into a career, while hopefully being able to pair it with other softwares I know such as ArcGIS Pro.
- 💻 I’m currently learning on runstone.academy, some YouTube videos, and Leet Code, sharpening my Python skills along the way.
- 🗺️ I’m looking to collaborate on ArcGIS Pro projects or really any other projects that I hope to be able to assist in and increase any applicable coding skills I can for a career.

- If anyone can give advice or criticism to help me learn I'd be as the Toy Story aliens say, "You have saved our lives, we are eternally grateful."
